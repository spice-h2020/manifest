# Scripting taxonomies

In nutshell: a script is a generic plan including a set of Tasks (e.g. Collect, Select, Design, Produce, Show) grouped in Stages. A script can be performed to achieve one or more Goals, entailing. Tasks are performed by several agents, having a specific Role in the context of the task at hand. These aspects are represented as either controlled vocabularies or Taxonomies of classes.
Tasks and Stages may be sequential, and can activate other tasks (e.g. on the basis of the output of a prior task). These aspects are represented as relations (not in scope here!).
